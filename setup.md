# Overview

This workshop is designed to be run on pre-imaged Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual machine
instances that will be provided to you on the first day of the workshop.  All of the data and most of the software used
in the workshop are hosted on your virtual machine.

Since you will be accessing your virtual machine through your own computer (your laptop), **some additional software, detailed below, must be installed on your computer**.  Primarily, you'll need three things:  
1.  A gwu.edu account - If you're from Children's Hospital, you might not have a gwu.edu account yet.  
2.  Windows users may need to set up a way to connect to a cloud computer (see below).  
3.  Any spreadsheet program that you can use to view files in formats such as Excel, CSV, Text-delimited, etc.  

Please follow the instructions below to prepare your computer for the workshop:

## gwu.edu Account

All workshop participants will need a GW UserID to access the cloud computing resources we will be using during the workshop.

If you are affiliated with Children's Hospital or another GW affiliate institution, you might not yet have a GW UserID.  If you think you might not have a GW UserID and we have not reached out to you to confirm your UserID, please let us know as soon as possible.

## Software Requirements

### Windows users only:  Setting up software you can use to connect to your cloud computer

> ## Windows
> - Open your Command Prompt app by searching for "cmd".  At the command prompt, type `ssh`.  Confirm that this prints out the usage information for the `ssh` command.  If the result is "Command not found" then you have a few options:
>   + Set up the Ubuntu Subsystem for Windows. This option is only available for Windows 10 - detailed [instructions are available here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install){:target="\_blank"}.
>   + Another option is to install the MobaXterm desktop app.  Please follow the download instructions at [mobaxterm.mobatek.net](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/){:target="\_blank"} to download the free edition.
